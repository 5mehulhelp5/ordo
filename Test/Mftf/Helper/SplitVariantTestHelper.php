/**
 * A split action's variant assignment (Model\Campaign\SplitVariantSelector::pickByWeight()) is
 * crc32("{campaignId}:{splitActionId}:customer:{customerId}") % 100 bucketed against each
 * variant's own weight - deterministic, but only computable once the campaign (and its split
 * action's own ordo_campaign_action.entity_id) has actually been saved through the real admin
 * UI, so neither id is known ahead of time. There is also no MFTF conditional/branching action to
 * pick "whichever of these pre-created customers lands in variant X" at the test-authoring level.
 *
 * This closes both gaps in one helper call: given the real campaign id and a delimited list of
 * already-created candidate customers (id + email), it looks up the split action's own real
 * entity_id, replicates SplitVariantSelector's exact algorithm for each candidate, and returns
 * the email of the first one landing in the requested variant - so the test itself never has to
 * branch, only to log in as whichever email comes back. Variant weights are fixed at 50/50 two
 * variants ('a'/'b') to match this suite's own split-action fixture exactly; a mismatch there
 * would make this helper's predictions wrong, not just imprecise, so it's a hardcoded assumption
 * documented here rather than a generic re-implementation of arbitrary variant configs.
