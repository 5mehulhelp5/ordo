/**
 * On sales_order_save_after, NOT sales_order_place_after like HoldOrderForApproval/
 * DispatchOrderPlacedCampaigns (this one is otherwise unrelated to either) - see
 * Observer\RecordCampaignOutcome's own docblock (the identical fix, same real bug, applied to
 * both observers at once) for the full reasoning: a fresh order's entity_id is genuinely
 * unpopulated at sales_order_place_after time for every normal (non-reorder) checkout, which
 * silently no-oped this every time since a real entity_id is required here (order_id is what
 * gets credited with the response) - confirmed the hard way via this module's own
 * AdminCampaignFunnelReflectsRealSendAndConversionTest.
 *
 * Closes the loop on Model\TriggerOutcomeLogger's own sent rows: if this customer was recently
 * sent one of the 5 cron-driven triggers and hasn't responded yet, this order counts as their
 * response. First-plausible-match, not exact attribution — see TriggerOutcomeLogger::markActed().
